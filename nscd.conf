# hosts caching is broken with gethostby* calls, hence is now disabled
# by default. Specifically, the caching does not obey DNS TTLs, and
# thus could lead to problems if the positive-time-to-live is
# significantly larger than the actual TTL.
#
# You should really use a caching nameserver instead of nscd for this
# sort of request. However, you can easily re-enable this by default.
